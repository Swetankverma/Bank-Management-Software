Designing a robust system that allows you to engage in transactions is something that every beginner should get started with. 
The proposed system is a web-based project that allows you to do everything a bank would allow you to do naturally.
One should be able to deposit money and withdraw money from a particular account as the user desires.
There should be a validation to allow only a particular amount of cash inflows at any time, as well as to allow withdraws if the balance is sufficient. 
There should also be the calculation of interest and its addition to the balance every month.

a) Check Balance: We can Check the current balance in your account.
b) Deposit Amount: How many money or amount would you want to deposite.
c) Withdraw Amount: How many money want to withdraw from your account.
d) Previous Transaction: It shows the previous transaction made by the user like: Deposite or Withdraw.
